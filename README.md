# Discord-Bot-Template

This is a basic bot template. It includes a command handler as well as a large selection of commands available. You can take whatever of them you want, then just create the bot based off of the code I've already made.

All required things for you to fill out are at the bottom of each document. I've tested this out enough times that it should work afterwards if you have the correct stuff set up.
